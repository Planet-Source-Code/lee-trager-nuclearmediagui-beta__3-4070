### Source Code

```
I started this project awhile back but now it seems ive been sucked into the linux work and im using OpenGL. This is still a good program people could learn off of. There are still a few bugs in it and it dosnt have all the features I want. It still shows you how to use most of the funtions of NuclearMedia plus some win api things.
Plz vote and write questions and comments.
